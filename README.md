### Introduction
Mokshya is an innovative webapp to merge the thrill of escape rooms with the intellectual challenge of coding problems. The concept revolves around creating an interactive breakout game experience where participants solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and progress through different levels by writing and debugging code.


### Why Mokshya?
Mokshya is more than just a project—it’s a vision to make learning and problem-solving engaging, accessible, and impactful. Here’s why Mokshya is the perfect choice for a hackathon project and beyond:

1. Engaging and Fun Learning
2. Bridging Learning and Entertainment
3. Skill Development Through Problem-Solving
4. Collaborative and Competitive Spirit
5. Adaptable for All Audiences
6. Real-World Applications
9. Alignment with Global Trends



### Tech Stacks Used
- MERN Stack: For developing the webapp(ReactJs for frontend, NodeJs with Express for backend and MongoDB for Database.),
- Genially: For game creation and integration,
- Framer motion, Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI: For User Interface Styling.
